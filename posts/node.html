              <h2 class="h2-title node-post">1 - what is node JS ?</h2>
              <p>
                Node JS is a JavaScript runtime environement that executes
                JavaScript on the web server or even directly on a computer,
                which means that we can use JavaScript as a server-side language
                just like other programming language like PHP, Python or Java.
                In order to understand how Node JS Works, let's first understand
                how computer works and how they understand code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Computers can only understand machine code ( also known as
                binary code ), but this code is really complex to write and read
                for us as human. so something called <i>assembly language</i> is
                built on top of this machine code, which is a litle bit easier
                to read and write, but this assembly language is still complex
                to read and write, that's why we have programmig languages like
                c++ built on top of this assembly language.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, now we can write C++ code on computer which is a much esier
                than assembly code, so the computer will understand it because
                it's compiled down to machine code.
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript is a progrmming language which abstracted even more
                away from machine code than C++ to make programming easier. But
                computer can not directly understand JavaScript or compiles it
                down to machine code, so we can not directly run JavaScript on a
                computer, but it can run inside a web browser such as Google
                Chrome, Firefox or Safari, but how does That work ?
              </p>
              <p>
                Inside each web browser there is a JavaScript engine That is
                written in C++ for example Google Chrome has V8 engine and
                Firefox has Spider Monkey. This JavaScript engine compiles
                JavaScript code into machine code at a runtime, so by passing
                JavaScript code through this this V8 engine in the browser the
                computer can then understand JavaScript, however it can not run
                JavaScript outside the browser, because there no V8 engine
                compiles it down to machine code outside the browser. And here
                is where Node JS come into play.
              </p>
              <p>
                Node JS is a software ( program ) also written into C++ and
                wraps the V8 engine, which means that the V8 engine lives inside
                the web browser also lives inside Node JS. Because Node JS is
                written in C++ it can run directly in our computer, which means
                by installing and runnig Node JS on our computer,it can take our
                JavaScript code and run it through the V8 engine that it has
                inside it and compiles it into machine that computer can
                understand.
              </p>
              <p>
                So now, using Node JS we can run JavaScript code directly on a
                computer or a server, but this is not just the only thing that
                Node JS can do. Node JS has other additional features such as
                read and write files on a computer using fs module ( Node Core
                Module ), connect to a database using Moongose ( 3rd Party
                Package ), act as a server for a content using http module (
                Node Core Module ) or Express ( 3rd Party Package ). Basically
                with Node JS you can do anything that other programming
                languages can do.

                2 - what does Node JS do on a website ?
              </h2>
              <p>
                The role of Node JS on a website or web application is basically
                to run JavaScript code on the backend. this JavaScript code
                might be handling requests that comes from the web browser,
                communicate with files on the server, intaracting with a
                database or sending responses back to the web browser. A server
                response could be an HTML page with dynamic data embedded inside
                it, maybe some CSS files or images.

                3 - why use node JS and not other technologies ?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Node JS is extremly fast, efficient and highly scalable, that's
                why is a good choice if you want to build the backend of a
                website or web application, it also has a feature of
                non-blocking code, and the most important is that Node JS give
                the ability to use the same language ( JavaScript ) that is used
                to build the frontend, so you can use only one programming
                language to build a full stack website or web application.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another reason of choosing Node JS is that it has a massive
                community behind it, there is always help if you need it or you
                are stuck on a problem. And there is also a huge amount of 3rd
                party packages that allow you to add functionalities to your web
                application without having to reinvent the wheel.

                Node JS has a large set of core modules that it comes with and
                the most used modules are fs, path, http and os.

              <p>
                When you intall Node JS you get something called NPM stands for
                Node Package Manager, this tool is used to install 3rd Party
                Packages or modules such as frameworks or libraries. These
                packages get stored in a folder that will be created
                automatically called <i>node_modules</i>, so any package that
                you install will get listed in a file called
                <i>package.json</i> which every Node JS project should include,
                this file holds information about your application like the
                name, the version and also a list of all dependencies that your
                application needs to run.

              <p>
                In Node JS you can also create your own modules which are simply
                files that have an export, this way you can export variables,
                functions, classes or anything else from one file and have
                access to them in another file using the require keyword.
