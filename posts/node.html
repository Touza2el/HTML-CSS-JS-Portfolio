              <h2 class="h2-title node-post">1 - what is node JS ?</h2>
              <p>
                Node JS is a JavaScript runtime environement that executes
                JavaScript on the web server or even directly on a computer,
                which means that we can use JavaScript as a server-side language
                just like other programming language like PHP, Python or Java.
                In order to understand how Node JS Works, let's first understand
                how computer works and how they understand code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Computers can only understand machine code ( also known as
                binary code ), but this code is really complex to write and read
                for us as human. so something called <i>assembly language</i> is
                built on top of this machine code, which is a litle bit easier
                to read and write, but this assembly language is still complex
                to read and write, that's why we have programmig languages like
                c++ built on top of this assembly language.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, we can write C++ code on computer which is a much esier than
                assembly code, so the computer will understand it because it's
                compiled down to machine code.
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript is a progrmming language which abstracted even more
                away from machine code than C++ to make programming easier. But
                computer can not directly understand JavaScript or compiles it
                down to machine code, so we can not directly run JavaScript on a
                computer, but it can run inside a web browser such as Google
                Chrome, Firefox or Safari, but how does That work ?
              </p>
              <p>
                Inside each web browser there is a JavaScript engine That is
                written in C++ for example Google Chrome has V8 engine and
                Firefox has Spider Monkey. This JavaScript engine compiles
                JavaScript code into machine code at a runtime, so by passing
                JavaScript code through this this V8 engine in the browser the
                computer can then understand JavaScript, however it can not run
                JavaScript outside the browser, because there is no V8 engine
                compiles it down to machine code outside the browser. And here
                is where Node JS come into play.
              </p>
              <p>
                Node JS is a software ( program ) also written into C++ and
                wraps the V8 engine, which means that the V8 engine that lives
                inside the web browser also lives inside Node JS. Because Node
                JS is written in C++ it can run directly in our computer, which
                means by installing and runnig Node JS on our computer, it can
                take our JavaScript code and run it through the V8 engine that
                it has inside it and compiles it into machine that computer can
                understand.
              </p>
              <p>
                So now, using Node JS we can run JavaScript code directly on a
                computer or a server, but this is not just the only thing that
                Node JS can do. Node JS has other additional features such as
                read and write files on a computer using fs module ( Node Core
                Module ), connect to a database using Moongose ( 3rd Party
                Package ), act as a server for a content using http module (
                Node Core Module ) or Express ( 3rd Party Package ). Basically
                with Node JS you can do anything that other programming
                languages can do.

                2 - what does Node JS do on a website ?
              </h2>
              <p>
                The role of Node JS on a website or web application is basically
                to run JavaScript code on the backend. this JavaScript code
                might be handling requests that comes from the web browser,
                communicate with files on the server, intaracting with a
                database or sending responses back to the web browser. A server
                response could be an HTML page with dynamic data embedded inside
                it, maybe some CSS files or images.

                3 - why use node JS and not other technologies ?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Node JS is extremly fast, efficient and highly scalable, that's
                why is a good choice if you want to build the backend of a
                website or web application, it also has a feature of
                non-blocking code, and the most important is that Node JS give
                us the ability to use the same language ( JavaScript ) that is
                used to build the frontend, so you can use only one programming
                language to build a full stack website or web application.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another reason of choosing Node JS is that it has a massive
                community behind it, there is always help if you need it or if
                you stuck on a problem. And there is also a huge amount of 3rd
                party packages that allow you to add functionalities to your web
                application without having to reinvent the wheel.

                Node JS has a large set of core modules that it comes with and

              <p>
                When you intall Node JS you get something called NPM which
                stands for Node Package Manager, this tool is used to install
                3rd Party Packages or modules such as frameworks or libraries.
                These packages get stored in a folder that will be created
                automatically called <i>node_modules</i>. Each package that you
                install from NPM will get listed in a file called
                <i>package.json</i> which every Node JS project should include,
                this file holds information about your application like the
                name, the version and also a list of all dependencies that your
                application needs to run.

                In Node JS you can also create your own modules which are simply
                files that have an export, this way you can export variables,
                functions, classes or anything else from one file and have
                access to them in another file using the require keyword.

                9 - create a web server using Node JS
              </h2>
              <p>
                After we've covered what is Node and the basics of how it works
                on a computer. Now it's time to build a web server that will
                power the backend of our website using Node JS and JavaScript,
                but before that let's first understand the process of
                communication between a web browser and a web server.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we type a website address or a domain name into a web
                browser, the browser send a request to the web server that's
                powering that particular website. When the web server recieve a
                request it decides what to do and what functions to perform
                based on that request, it may communicate to an external API or
                interact with a database, and then send back a response to the
                web browser in most cases that will be an HTML page, CSS files,
                images or JSON data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now we know how a web browser communicate with a web server, but
                how does the browser know to send a request to the correct web
                server, to answer this question we need to know a litle bit
                about IP adrresses, domain name system ( DNS ) and HTTP.
              </p>
              <p>
                An <strong>IP Addresses</strong> are like addresses for
                computers, each computer connected to the internet has a unique
                IP address that identify it, when we create a website we need to
                host it on a special computer ( known as a host ). If we want to
                connect a server on that host computer we need to know its IP
                address.
              </p>
              <p>
                IP addresses are just series of numbers and it's hard to
                remember them that's why we use domain names to mask these IP
                addresses. And then when we type a domain name into a web
                browser it will communicate with a <strong>DNS</strong> ( stands
                for Domain Name System ) to find the IP address that associted
                with the specified domain name. Then the browser use that IP
                address to find the computer that host the website and
                communicate with it. This way the web browser can send requests
                to this computer and get back responses from it.
              </p>
              <p>
                This communication between the client and the server is done via
                <strong>HTTP</strong> stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and
                has four important methods that a web browser use to communicate
                with a web server.
              </p>
              <h3 class="h3-title">creating a web server :</h3>
              <p>
                In Node JS we manually write code to create a server which lives
                on the backend of our website, listen for requests coming in
                from the browser, perform some functions based on these request
                and then send back responses to the browser. This totally
                different from a language like PHP where we don't have to create
                the server manually because we have other tools manage that for
                us like apache
              </p>
              <p>
                In the rest of this article we will focus on how to create a
                local server on our computer using Node JS, which can then be
                used to actively listen for browser requests and respond to
                them.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Now let's write some code </strong></p>
              <p>1 - Open Your Text Editor ( Visual Studio Code )</p>
              <p>2 - Create a folder called it <strong>app</strong></p>
              <p>
                3 - inside the app folder Create a file called it
                <strong>server.js</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The server.js file is where we are going to create the server
              </p>
              <p>
                4 - inside the server.js file we need to require a core node
                module :
                <strong>http module</strong>
              </p>
              <div class="code-image">
                <img src="../images/node-server/1.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <p>now we can use this http module to create a server</p>
              <div class="code-image">
                <img src="../images/node-server/2.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <p>
                This <strong>createServer()</strong> method take a callback
                function as an argument, this call back function will run every
                time a request comes to the server and it has access to two
                different objects ( req and res ). The request object contains
                information about the request, the response object is the object
                that we use to send a response to the browser.
              </p>
              <div class="code-image">
                <img src="../images/node-server/3.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <p>
                After we create our web server now we need to invoke the
                <strong>listen()</strong> method, this method accept three
                argument, the first argument is the port number which is in our
                case 3000, the second argument take 'localhost' as a default
                parameter and the third argument is a callback function that
                will fire when we start listening.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>localhost : </strong>is like a domain name that we use
                on the web, but this one takes us to a very specific IP address
                (127.0.0.1) that point to our computer, that means when we are
                connecting to the localhost domain in a browser, the browser is
                actually connecting back to our own computer which is the act as
                a host for our website
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>port numbers : </strong> are like 'doors' into a
                computer through which internet communications can be made to
                different programs
              </p>
              <div class="code-image">
                <img src="../images/node-server/4.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <p>
                So now, we have created a web server and we are listening to
                port 3000 on the localhost. The only thing that we need to do,
                is to run the server.js file through node by typing the command
                bellow on the terminal and then we can start sending request to
                this server.
              </p>
              <div class="code-image image-with-text">
                <span><em>Open The Terminal and Type This Command :</em></span>
                <img src="../images/node-server/5.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <p>
                In the previous section we see that the
                <em>createServer()</em> accept a callback function that has
                access to the request and the response objects. In this section
                we will see how we can use this response object to send back a
                respone to the browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                - <em>The 1st step </em> that we should in order to send a
                response back to the browser is to set the response headers
                using
                <strong>steHeader()</strong>
                function. Response headers give the browser some information
                about what kind of response is coming back to it for example
                type of data we sending back, is it text, HTML page, CSS files,
                images or JSON data, we can also use the response headers to set
                cookies on the browser.
              </p>
              <div class="code-image">
                <img src="../images/node-server/6.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <p>
                - <em>The 2nd step </em>is to write whatever content we want to
                send back to the browser using <strong>write()</strong> method.
              </p>
              <div class="code-image">
                <img src="../images/node-server/7.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <p>
                - <em>The 3rd step </em>is to end the response
                <strong>end()</strong> method which then sends it to the
                browser.
              </p>
              <div class="code-image">
                <img src="../images/node-server/8.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <p>
                Now, if we run our server and we go back to the browser and make
                a request to the localhost on port 3000 using the URL :
                <i>" localhost:3000 "</i> , we will get a response back from the
                server and this response is just a simple text 'Hello World'
                that will be printed on the browser screen.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we want to send back some HTML instead of plain text, we have
                to change the value of the Content-Type property to 'text/html'
                and then pass our HTML to the <strong>write()</strong> method
                and then end the response using the
                <strong>end()</strong> method.
              </p>
              <div class="code-image">
                <img src="../images/node-server/9.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <p>
                Now, let's see how we can send<strong> static files</strong>
                like HTML pages, CSS files or JavaScript files to the browser
              </p>
              <p>
                Fisrt we need to create a folder called
                <strong>views</strong> inside our <strong>app</strong> folder
                and then we create an <strong>index.html</strong> file that we
                want to send to the browser inside our
                <strong>views</strong> folder
              </p>
              <p>and the we write some code into our HTML file :</p>
              <div class="code-image">
                <img src="../images/node-server/10.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <p>
                Now, in order to send this HTML file to the browser whenever a
                user make a request for it we need firt to read this file using
                the <strong>readFile()</strong> method of the core Node JS
                module fs, and then send the data from that file as a response
                to the browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                But first we need to require the Node core module
                <strong>(fs)</strong> on top of our
                <strong>server.js</strong> file.
              </p>
              <div class="code-image">
                <img src="../images/node-server/11.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <p>
                Now, if we run our server and send a request from the browser to
                the server we should get back that HTML file as a response.
              </p>
              <h3 class="h3-title">basic routing</h3>
              <p>
                Routing give us the ability to send a different data or
                different HTML pages depending on the route that a user visit,
                so we need a way to figure out the URL that a user request and
                depending on that URL the server send back a different data.
              </p>
              <div class="code-image">
                <img src="../images/node-server/12.PNG" alt="node " />
              </div>
              <h3 class="h3-title">status code</h3>
              <p>
                Status codes describe the type of response being sent to the
                browser, there is many different status codes and the most
                common ones are :
              </p>
              <p><strong>200 : </strong> Means that everything is OK.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>301 : </strong> The resource was removed permanently to
                somewhere else.
              </p>
              <p><strong>404 : </strong> Page or file is not found.</p>
              <p><strong>500 : </strong> Internal server errors.</p>
